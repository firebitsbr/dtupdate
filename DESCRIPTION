Title: Keep Up-To-Date with Non-CRAN Package Updates
Version: 1.5

Description: CRAN and Bioconductor users have mechanisms to update their
    installed packages but those of us who live in the devtools GitHub world
    are levt to intall_github all on our own. This package fills that gap
    by providing a function that attempts to figure out which packages were
    installed from GitHub and then tries to figure
    out which ones have updates (i.e. the GitHub version is > local version).
    It provides an option (not recommended) to (optionally, selectively)
    auto-update any packages with newer GitHub development versions.
