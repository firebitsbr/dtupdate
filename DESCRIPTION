Title: The dtupdate package has functions that try to make it easier to keep up
    with the non-CRAN universe
Version: 1.4
Date: 2014-08-31

Description: dtupdate attempts to figure out which packages have non-CRAN
    versions (currently only looks for github ones) and then tries to figure
    out which ones have updates (i.e. the github version is > local version).
    It provides an option (not recommended) to (optionally, selectively)
    auto-update any packages with newer development versions.
