Title: The dtupdate package has functions that try to make it easier to keep up with the non-CRAN universe
Version: 1.0
Date: 2014-08-21
Author: Bob Rudis (@hrbrmstr)
Maintainer: Bob Rudis <bob@rudis.net>
Description: dtupdate attempts to figure out which packages have non-CRAN
    versions (currently only looks for github ones) and then tries to figure
    out which ones have updates (i.e. the github version is > local version).
    It provides an option (not recommended) to auto-update any packages
    with newer development versions.
