dtupdate News

- Version 1.4 adds a whats_new() function that uses rmarkdown to produce an
  HTML report from all the available NEWS[.md] files for any packages
  that have updates

- Version 1.3 works with both the BugReports: and URL: field and
  handles some additional URL-retrieving exceptions

- Version 1.2 switches from plyr to dplyr to stop @jayjacobs from whining,
  removes the libLoc switch from version 1.1 and replaces it with a boolean
  all parameter which let's you switch from inspecting the github packages
  installed across all library paths or just the first one
  (*usually* your user/local path), and adds a show.location parameter
  which will include the library path for each package in the data frame return

- Version 1.1 incorporates functionality from Thomas J Leeper's gist,
  including the ability to interactively select which packages to install,
  the option to specify which `libLoc` will be searched by installed.packages
  and handling of a fringe case where the repo name does not match the package
  name (ironically, this was due to Hadley's reshape repo for
  the reshape2 package)

- Version 1.0 released (nascent github pkg update capability)
