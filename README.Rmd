# dtupdate

Keep Up-To-Date with Non-CRAN Package Updates

## Description

CRAN and Bioconductor users have mechanisms to update their
installed packages but those of us who live in the devtools GitHub world
are levt to intall_github all on our own. This package fills that gap
by providing a function that attempts to figure out which packages were
installed from GitHub and then tries to figure
out which ones have updates (i.e. the GitHub version is > local version).
It provides an option (not recommended) to (optionally, selectively)
auto-update any packages with newer GitHub development versions.

The following functions are implemented:

- `github_update` - find, report and optionally update packages installed from or available on github

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/dtupdate")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
options(width=120)
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(dtupdate)

# current verison
packageVersion("dtupdate")

# see what packages are available for an update
github_update()

```

## Test Results

```{r}

test_dir("tests/")
```
